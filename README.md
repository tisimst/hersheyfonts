# hersheyfonts
OTF versions of A. H. Hershey's fonts

The Hershey fonts are a great congolmerate of many fonts that I've broken down into separate styles and optical sizes (17 in all):
* English Gothic Display
* German Gothic Display
* Italic Gothic Display
* Map symbols
* Math symbols
* Modern music symbols
* Oldstyle music symbols
* Sans Display (Duplex)
* Sans Display (Simplex)
* Sans Micro (Simplex)
* Electrical Schematic symbols
* Script Display (Complex)
* Script Display (Simplex)
* Serif Display (Triplex)
* Serif Display (Complex)
* Serif Text (Complex)
* Weather symbols

The main optical sizes are MICRO, TEXT, and DISPLAY.

The various stem weights have 1, 2, and 3 skeleton strokes: SIMPLEX, DUPLEX/COMPLEX, TRIPLEX

Since the Hershey fonts really only consists of glyph skeletons, in the form of linear segments that a plotter would follow, each of the fonts contained here are available in the following standard weights and widths:

9 Weights:
* (100) Thin
* (200) ExtraLight
* (300) Light
* (400) Regular
* (500) Medium
* (600) SemiBold
* (700) Bold
* (800) ExtraBold
* (900) Black

9 Widths:
* UltraCondensed (abbreviated as "UltraCond")
* ExtraCondensed (abbreviated as "ExtraCond")
* Condensed (abbreviated as "Cond")
* SemiCondensed (abbreviated as "SemiCond")
* Medium
* SemiExpanded (abbreviated as "SemiExp")
* Expanded (abbreviated as "Exp")
* ExtraExpanded (abbreviated as "ExtraExp")
* UltraExpanded (abbreviated as "UltraExp")

In addition to the above weights, I tried to match the original plotter sizes as closely as possible with three additional weights to match the plotting machines SC-4010 (which is barely lighter than Black), SC-4020 (which is barely lighter than Bold), and SC-4060 (which is slightly heavier than Light).

All in all, each of the text fonts has been rendered in each weight/width combination, resulting in 11x12x9=1188 font files. Each symbol font has been rendered in each weight, resulting in 6x12=72 font files for a grand total of 1260 font files!
